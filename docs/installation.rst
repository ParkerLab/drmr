Installation
============

Requirements
------------

* Python. We've run it successfully under versions 2.7.10 and 3.5.
* Jinja2 (If you install drmr with pip, Jinja2 should be installed automatically.)
* lxml (Again, pip should install it for you.)

How to install
--------------

At the command line::

  git clone https://github.com/ParkerLab/drmr
  pip install ./drmr

Or in one step::

  pip install git+https://github.com/ParkerLab/drmr

The dependencies should be installed automatically via pip's requirements.
